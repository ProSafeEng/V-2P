|| Vertical 2-Phase Separator (V-2P.exe) ||

Vertical 2-Phase separator design or sizing is normal for a process engineer's life when he deals with many configurations like Knock-out drums for various applications.

A vertical vessel with a demister design is simple as well as complicated if it contains a supplier-specific design and a special type of internals for tight separation.

A process engineer can design or program such a type of separator based on study and sizing equations available in the literature.

Final confirmation on separation guarantee and design dimensions if applicable is a rely upon an internal supplier for the specific application e.g. compressor KODs

For bulk separation and normal application when the guarantee parameter is not involved vessel dimensions estimation is straightforward.

I have developed a simple application that will help to generate Vertical 2-Phase separator sizing/design code in a few clicks. Later an engineer can modify the equations and can generate his own sizing program which will help him to learn the coding and design process engineering task.

There is a lot of stuff to be added to make such an Application robust and powerful.

This is my first try to make it interactive and useful for the chemical engineering community.
